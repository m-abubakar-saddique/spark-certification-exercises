# Spark Certification Practices

This repository contains Python/Spark notebook files that represent the practices I do for the preparation of Databricks Spark Certifcation.

The notebooks in this repository are a great way to learn how to use Spark for data engineering tasks. They are also a good way to reference the code for specific practices.

To get started, you can clone the repository to your local machine and open the notebooks in a Jupyter notebook environment that has Spark installed. Alternatively, you can use this on Spark-enabled environments like Databricks or Colab (I used Google Colab to run these notebooks ).

## Contributing

If you find any errors in the notebooks, or if you have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Good Luck!! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ
